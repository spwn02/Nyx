Usage Notes:
-----------
- Designed for PBR Metallic/Roughness workflows. For Specular/Glossiness workflows, you may need to invert the Roughness map inside your target software/render engine using that workflow.
- Normal Maps are provided in OpenGL format (+Y). If your target application uses DirectX (-Y), you will need to invert the Green channel of the Normal Map. (Common feature in most render engines)
- Connect maps according to standard PBR practices in your chosen software.
- All maps in this Texture set folder are designed and output at 4K resolution. Exceptions - Metallic, Anistropic, SSS, and AO maps MAY be at lower resolutions such as 256px,512px, or 1K, when they represent a uniform calibrated colour value. (Optimised file size, same result)
